### Welcome to Emerson Leatherworks

This is a website I built as a solo project on the weekends during my time as a student in Fullstack Academy. 
I taught myself the basics of React-Bootstrap to design a better looking UI.
The site showcases my leatherworking skills, and -when I am less busy, and commision space has opened up- allows new clients to contact me via a simple form.
